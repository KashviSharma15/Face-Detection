<br>
The goal of this project was to build a robust and accurate deep learning model that can classify input images as face or not using a dataset sourced from Kaggle. In this we have dataset which had several face and non-face images(cat ,dog, monkey, horse , flower etc) and the model is then trained to detect whether the image is a human face or not. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was employed as it is particularly effective for spatial feature extraction and classification tasks involving images.<br>
<b>Dataset :</b>
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sagarkarar/nonface-and-face-dataset <br>
**Apart from this I have added few more images from other dataset and my personal folders as well , to add variety and balance the number of face and non-face images.
